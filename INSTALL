1. 	Unzip/Untar all of the japha files into a directory with a name that makes you happy 
	with yourself. Make sure you name that directory Japha (japha if you are on linux or bsd). 
	Believe me, you will be happy.

2.	Upload all of the files from japha/ onto your webserver, preferrably in the root directory.
	( http://www.yourcooldomain.com/japha ). This is not mandatory, we just require it. ;]
	
2.	Open the file Japha/global.conf file and edit the settings to your liking.
	In this file you can disable certain packages from being used -- In case you are crazy or
	some other ailment has stricken you.
	
3.	Run Japha/test.php once you've got the library uploaded. This will tell you stuff about
	what you did wrong. Most likely, you will have forgotten to name the directory Japha (japha),
	or maybe you didn't put it in your root directory. Hey, maybe you just skipped number 3 and
	decided that miracles happen. They don't, only reflection does (java.lang.reflect-ion, that is).
	
4.	Once you've gotten all of the error messages cleared out of your install, you are ready to rock.
	To include files, simple type 
	
	<? include 'japha/packageName.php'; ?>
	
	This will include all of the files and dependencies for that package. The main dependency 
	throughout Japha is the japha.lang package
	(not it's subpackages, but they are included by default).
	
5. 	If you get some crazy stuff, check with your sysAdmin -- do you have PHP5 installed?!
	If you are sure you asked your sysAdmin, then make a file called 'phpinfo.php' and include the
	following line in it:
	
	<? phpinfo(); ?>
	
	It will show you some pretty hefty diagnostic information about your PHP install. Go about
	halfway down the page (before scrolling), and you will see a little pointless blurb that
	says something about your installation. Make sure that somewhere in there the PHP version
	is PHP 5.0.0-dev/Zend 2.0.0-dev or higher. If they aren't at least 5/2, then Japha WILL NOT
	work.

1.	We're going to assume that you've set up Japha before, so we'll skip those standard steps up
 	there, mostly because you are selecting which packages you want to embed. You can choose as
 	many or as little as you'd like.
 	
2.	No matter what you decide to include or discard, one thing must be used -- japha.lang.Object.
 	This is the root for all classes, and to leave it out would be to commit a grand sin. Now,
 	there are several other classes in japha.lang that are highly recommended (actually, all of
 	them SHOULD be required, but most of them are just regarded as such -- it's not enforced, if
 	you really want to take the time to remove all the dependencies).
 	
3.	You should still follow suit with a normal installation and include the japha files in a 
	directory at the root of your project called japha/ -- That way, you won't have to worry about
	everything being consistent.
	
4.	Since you already know exactly which packages you will be using, there should be no need to
	edit those values in the configuration files -- You won't need to set limits, you can just leave
	those packages out of your final product.
	
5.	Right now would be a good idea to edit 'all.php', if you plan on using that to include your
	hand-picked packages. If you get any errors, hopefully you will be able to debug them. They
	will probably just consist of a missing interface somewhere, or some other odd and subtle bug
	that will take you hours to find. But we'll not think those thoughts.
	
	
Future:
	In the future we hope to have a more intuitive distribution system that will allow you to
	only download the packages that you want, and be able to get the right dependencies just
	for those packages.
	
	Until then, be strong, be brave -- Embed.

And make sure you tell us about it! We WANT to know what you think of Japha!
